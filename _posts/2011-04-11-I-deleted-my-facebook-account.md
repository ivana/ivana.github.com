I had never actually liked that Facebook idea of "connecting" with people you don't get to see often in your everyday life (obviously, there's a good reason for that).

Almost 3 years ago I started to travel a lot, and Facebook seemed fitting for staying in contact with new friends who I wasn't going to see that soon, if ever. So I signed up. I never used it to "collect" each and every person I had ever met; I had around 80â€“90 "friends" when I [scheduled it for deletion][fbdelete] (that's right, [you can delete it][fbdeletegroup], not just deactivate, and it works). My criteria for connecting with someone were:

1. person is a friend,
2. we're not particularly close (met a couple of times / haven't seen each other for years), but I like him / her, and want to stay in touch.

So Facebook and I lived in harmony as long as I thought of it as a contact book, though I caught myself a number of times evaluating who I should be friends with on Facebook. I take friendships seriously, and I felt uncomfortable being virtually surounded mostly by people that are merely acquaintances. And making a list of "true" friends is something I find insane, which is how I felt with Facebook.

I don't want to go much into how other people spend time on Facebook. As for myself, I disliked being a part of a judging, stalking, Big Brother generation. Also, people I wanted to stay in contact with shared tons of information I didn't need to know (news, music videos, quizzes, out of context status messages), which totally missed the initial point of staying in touch, just left me swamped with feeds of trivia, and distorted image of people I know, or used to know. I realized:

1. I'm in touch with people I really care about, mostly through other ways of communication (IM, email, phone, OMG seeing in person!), Facebook brought nothing new in this regard for me.
2. I prefer Twitter for keeping up with people I like.
3. *I don't want to "stay in touch".* Location and circumstances create friendships, they shouldn't be kept alive artificially.

I've been off Facebook for 1 month, and I'm happy :)
