It's becoming impossible to keep up with all of the great ones out there (right now there's more than 40 podcasts to listen in my [Instacast](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast)), but here's my narrow selection.

Web development:

* [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com) - About front-end web development & design, featuring awesome guests, with questions from listeners.
* [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com)

Education & Comedy:

* [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/) (up to 60 min) - "Science meets culture" in a form of stories, investigations, and experiences.
* [60-Second Science](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/podcasts.cfm?type=60-second-science) (1 min) - Daily commentary on some of the interesting news in the world of science.
* [The Moth](http://themoth.org) or "True stories told live" (~ 20 min)
* [a show with zefrank](http://ashow.zefrank.com) (~ 3 min)
* [Savage Lovecast](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLovePodcast/Page) (~ 50 min) - Advice columnist Dan Savage answers questions about sex and relationships. Insightful, provocative, and funny.

Language:

* [Learn French with daily podcasts](http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/learn-french-daily-podcasts/id191303933?mt=2) (~ 5 min) - Useful to stay in touch with your existing (beginner to intermediate) French, and expand your vocabulary. Funny accent included. (Louis is adorable.)
* [Grammar Girl Quick and Dirty Tips](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com) (5&ndash;10 min) - English grammar, punctuation, and style.
* [Lexicon Valley](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley.html) (20&ndash;30 min) - Simply about language.

I only recently discovered [The Art of Photography](http://theartofphotography.tv) and really like it.
I also occasionally listen to [Big Ideas](http://bigideas.tvo.org/podcasts), [Ruby Freelancers](http://rubyfreelancers.com), and [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w).
