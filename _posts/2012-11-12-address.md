title: Don't forget the address

Though its role is quite simple, the <code>address</code> element seems to be easily forgotten, or even misunderstood &ndash; it *is* named somewhat misleadingly. In short, you should use it to indicate the **contact info for a web page**, like an email or website address.

<cite>The spec</cite> is crisp about it: <q cite="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-address-element">The <code>address</code> element represents the contact information for its nearest <code>article</code> or <code>body</code> element ancestor. If that is the <code>body</code> element, then the contact information applies to the document as a whole.</q>

(For example, I wrapped the "contact me" link on [my homepage](/) in it.)

Have a look at [the <code>address</code> element in the HTML standard][address], it's a short read.

**Important note**: Don't use the <code>address</code> element for marking up addresses in general, such as postal addresses (unless they represent the actual contact, of course). For that purpose, use the [adr format](http://microformats.org/wiki/adr), a property of the [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hCard) microformat.
