title: iPhone 365
---

Yesterday I finished my "iPhone 365":iPhone365 project, a photography project I started 1 year ago. Well-known among photographers, 365 is a project for taking a photo each day for a year. There are no other rules: you choose your photo equipment, subjects you photograph, when to start with it. It allows a lot of space for creativity with a simple goal: to become better at photography.

I decided to make it an iPhone 365 project for 3 simple reasons:

# I "started a 365":56/365 once before that, only to quit it after less than 2 months. I wasn't always eager to carry a bulky SLR with me, and editing photos required way too much time and dedication on a daily basis, to the point where it became a real drag.
# It's a euphemism to say that I worship my iPhone 4, mostly because of its fabulous camera; it never leaves my side (and needless to say, the best camera is the one that's always with you).
# There are so many great iPhone apps for taking and editing your photos. I will list the ones I used.

h1. My favourite photo apps

# Built-in camera app. With its irreplaceable HDR setting, it's still my most preferred app for shooting. I used all the other apps only for editing (apart from Hipstamatic).

# "Camera+":http://campl.us/. Really the ultimate photo app, I used it for 90% of the shots. Not only for its great effects, but it also offers a variety of white balance choices, built-in timer, etc. I could have easily renamed my project to Camera+ 365.

# "Instagram":http://instagr.am/. The most social photo app, fast and with beautiful effects. Everybody knows it, everybody loves it.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ivanavasilj/6465705523/in/set-72157625092360131/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7150/6465705523_ff29e79906_d.jpg" alt="298/365: PoÅ¡ta"></a>
# "Hipstamatic":http://hipstamatic.com/the_app.html. The name says it all. I love its look, retro feel, and the random mode. The "most lomo" app, just shoot and don't look back.

# "CrossProcess":http://bananacameraco.com/crossprocess/. Admirably emulated cross processed film, great results.

h1. The experience

The greatest benefit I got from doing this is the community feedback from my Flickr friends, great number of them coming from "The Daily Shoot":dailyshoot project, which unfortunately is no longer active, but it had great daily assignments to keep me motivated, and connect with people who are doing the same thing.

Staying motivated is a real bummer here: I certainly had plenty of days where I would just point to and shoot the first thing I saw ("one example of that":downExample). Having a great idea for a shot for 365 days (and execute it) is hardly likely, so there were plenty of ups &amp; downs. My favourite (and totally unexpected) ups were the "3 of my photos that got explored on Flickr":explored.

We all know that practice makes perfect. What makes 365 a great project is that you can do it even if you never had a camera in your hands. Even if you don't become much better at photography, and you definitely will, you'll have one year of your life in photos, a unique and irreplaceable souvenir worth having.
