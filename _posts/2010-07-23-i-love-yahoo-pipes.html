<p>
  I wanted to add a section to this site, called <a href="/echoes">Echoes</a>, that would just "paste" my recent
  (anti)social activity, such as tweets, bookmarks etc. The idea was:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>grab the content from social networks,</li>
  <li>aggregate, transform and filter it to contain only recent activity,</li>
  <li>output the desired result as JSON (so I can include it easily into content on my site with a bit of javascript).</li>
</ol>
<p>
  And that's just what <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a> does. I couldn't stop playing with it.
  The result is the <a href="/echoes">echoes</a> page here.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/ivana/echoes">Echoes pipe</a> is public, so feel free to view the source or clone it.
  You can also view my jQuery code for <a href="/js/site.js">including the JSON pipe output in my markup</a>.
