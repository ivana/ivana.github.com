  Well it was about time for me to have my site / blog &ndash; first and only.
  It is powered by <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> (which is absolutely great)
  and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
  It is also pure HTML5 ;)
</p>
<p>
  Here I'll be writing about <a href="/about#interests">various stuff of my interest</a>,
  which you may find useful / interesting as well, so <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ivanavasilj">stay tuned</a>.
</p>
