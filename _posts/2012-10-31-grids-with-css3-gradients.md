title: Baseline and multi-column grids with CSS3 linear gradients

I wrote [these snippets](https://gist.github.com/3947218) using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) (with a dash of [Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/) to forget about vendor prefixes). They can be quite helpful when composing a page both vertically and horizontally, all within few lines of code you can write yourself, no need for extra CSS frameworks. I hope you make use of them for your grid layouts as well, or at least get the general idea.
