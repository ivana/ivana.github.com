        Yes, I just had to make my own to-do app. So, what's different with this one?
        It's simple: you get to see all your todos at once, grouped in lists. And it looks great on the iPhone.
        It's built with Rails and jQuery, and <a href="https://github.com/ivana/todofrenzy">opensourced on github</a>.

        Go ahead and use it, it's free, you just need your Twitter account to sign in.

    <li id="movi">
      <h2><a href="http://movi.im/">Movi.im</a></h2>
      
      <a href="http://movi.im/"><img src="/img/moviim.png" alt="Movi.im screenshot" /></a>

      <p>
        This is a simple Rails app that <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/">Mislav</a> and I created
        (find out more about other technologies used on <a href="http://movi.im/about">movi.im</a>).

        It keeps track of movies you watched, those you want to watch, what your Twitter and Facebook friends watch.
        Try it out, and also try to beat my number of movies watched ;)
