      A Rails app that <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/">Mislav</a> and I created, it's still work in progress.
      It keeps track of movies you watched, those you want to watch, what your Twitter and Facebook friends watch...
      Try it out!

      Find out more about the technologies we used on <a href="http://movi.im/about">movi.im</a>.
      And try to beat the number of <a href="http://movi.im/ivana" rel="me"> movies I watched</a> ;)

      Yes, I just had to make my own to-do app. So, what's different with this one?
      It's simple: you get to see all your todos at once, grouped in lists. And it looks great on the iPhone.
      It's built with Rails and jQuery, and <a href="https://github.com/ivana/todofrenzy">opensourced on github</a>.

      Go ahead and use it, it's free, you just need your Twitter account to sign in.
