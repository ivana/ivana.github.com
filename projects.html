      Yes, I just had to make my own to-do app. So, what's different with this one?
      It's simple: you get to see all your todos at once, grouped in lists. And it looks great on the iPhone.
      It's built with Rails and jQuery, and <a href="https://github.com/ivana/todofrenzy">opensourced on github</a>.

      Go ahead and use it, it's free, you just need your Twitter account to sign in.

      This is a simple Rails app that <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/">Mislav</a> and I created
      (find out more about other technologies used on <a href="http://movi.im/about">movi.im</a>).

      It keeps track of movies you watched, those you want to watch, what your Twitter and Facebook friends watch.
      Try it out! Also try to beat the number of <a href="http://movi.im/ivana" rel="me"> movies I watched</a> ;)
