  <h1>Projects</h1>

  <p>
    In my personal projects, I code in Ruby on Rails.<br>
    In 2012, I was a <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> coach at two events,
    in <a href="http://railsgirls.com/zagreb">Zagreb</a>, and <a href="http://railsgirls.com/ljubljana">Ljubljana</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://github.com/ivana" rel="me">My open-source code</a> is hosted on GitHub.
    Some of my <i>pets</i> are listed below.
  </p>

    <h2><a href="http://smokefreebars.herokuapp.com/">Smoke-free bars in Zagreb</a></h2>
    <p>
      I used Foursquare API, Google Maps API, Rails 3.2, CoffeeScript, jQuery, and MongoDB with Mongoid.
      Open-sourced <a href="http://github.com/ivana/smokefreebars">on GitHub</a>.

    <h2><a href="http://movi.im/">movi.im</a></h2>
    <p>
      This is a Rails app that <a href="http://twitter.com/mislav">@mislav</a> and I created, and it's still a work in progress.
      It keeps track of movies you watch, as well as ones you want to watch, and what your friends watch.
      If you're crazy about movies, you should definitely <a href="http://movi.im/">try it out</a>.
      Can you beat the number of the <a href="http://movi.im/ivana" rel="me">movies I've watched</a>?
