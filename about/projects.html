      <p>
        A <a href="http://todaslistas.heroku.com/">simple todo app</a> &ndash; you get to see all your todos at once,
        which was exactly what I wanted and couldn't find in other apps out there. So I made my own. It's a Rails / jQuery app.
        Go ahead, use it (of course it's free) and let me know what you think ;)
