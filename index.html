  <h1>Hi.</h1>

  <p>You've reached a home of a <span class=title><strong>front-end engineer</strong>, photographer, and language nerd</span>.</p>
  <p>
    I'm <strong class="fn n" lang=hr><span class=given-name>Ivana</span> <span class=family-name>Vasilj</span></strong>,
    and I care about:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Writing clean and maintainable code and markup,</li>
   <li>Device-agnostic website performance and user experience,</li>
   <li>HTML 5 semantics,</li>
   <li>Pixel-perfection,</li>
   <li>Responsive Web Design,</li>
   <li>Version control through Git.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'm a big fan of SCSS, Bourbon, CoffeeScript, Zepto, and Ruby on Rails.
