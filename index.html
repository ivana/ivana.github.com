  <h1>Hi.</h1>

  <p>
    I'm <strong class="fn n" lang=hr><span class=given-name>Ivana</span> <span class=family-name>Vasilj</span></strong>,

  </p>

  <p>I care about:</p>
  <ul>

   <li>HTML 5 semantics,</li>
   <li>Pixel-perfection and "retinafying",</li>
   <li>Responsive Web Design,</li>
   <li>Cross-browser compatibility,</li>
   <li>Version control through Git,</li>
   <li>Device-agnostic website performance and user experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Also a big fan of SCSS, Bourbon, CoffeeScript, and Zepto.

    I've been working as a full-stack developer throughout most of my experience, with various databases and programming languages.
    But building UIs is what I enjoy the most.
    Also working with Ruby on Rails.
